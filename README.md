# fanfiction-data-visualization-1
Several data visualizations I created using R for my Directed Research Group in Human Centered Design &amp; Engineering at the University of Washington. The data comes from a set of 500 fanfiction reviews I qualitatively coded by hand. I then used R to create several data visualizations that show the word counts found in each fanfiction review, sorted by valence.
