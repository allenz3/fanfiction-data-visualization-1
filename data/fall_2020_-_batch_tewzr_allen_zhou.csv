8921596,"Just re-read my latest review, and I think it might be misinterpreted. I didn't mean I had had enough of this story, I meant that my re-read was done. I'm with you until the end, whether it be bitter or joyful. Also, I don't remember the Goddess specifically telling Anna that her powers came from their healing sessions; I just thought she told her she had been useful because she sensed some latent magic in her, then kicked her ass. Unless she visited her later while Anna was chained up (unlikely), they didn't have any conversation about where Anna's powers came from at that time. After all, if they did, Anna would wonder why Elsa allowed her to be enhanced, as she does in this chapter. It's not a big deal, since throughout the story, both women believed that Anna's strength came from Elsa's healing powers, and had all but dismissed Drell's account since it didn't tally with reality (Elsa wasn't an evil goddess). This chapter just seems to imply that the goddess spelled out the ""reason"" for Anna's powers, despite such a thing not happening in the text. Also, when Drell says that magic from gods can only go to ""their children, or those that they love"", does that mean that they don't love their children instinctively? Considering that this is a ""Frozen"" fiction, and the fact that you had Rapunzel giving her brother a true love's kiss earlier, this phrasing just seems really awkward. Maybe change it to ""those with whom they fell in love"", so that it becomes more specifically about romantic love, and stresses that point to Anna.","Targeted corrective or constructive,Discussion about the story,Fandom remarks,Two-sided connection",Confused,Neutral

Oooooooh I loved it, the idea for a play is just ingenious and I absolutely adore the way the way that you completely got their excitement across, just the way they would have acted :D you have, as always, got their characters completely down to a T and I love love LOVE the way that you describe the setting and their clothes and everything just so perfectly! I realise that you have had to put this on pause but I hope that you will find some time somewhere to tell us who wins! Personally I'm rooting for the team with the mad cow and John and nancy :D as I do a ridiculously large amount of acting myself I was very pleased with how both productions we're written. You could perhaps have explained the set in a little bit more detail and perhaps announced where they were entering from such as stage-left or downstage right and those sort of things to help the reader get a better image but I think I'm probably just being picky having done too many drama shows and drama stuff :D if you need any help with the technical side of drama to decode which team wins I would be happy to help. If you like you could email me (I'll give you my email more privately somehow :D). But I absolutely loved the two chapters updated! Thought they were absolutely perfect and I even feel like you're improving! If that's even possible! Feel do proud even though you're probably older than me but I've stuck with you, mostly :/ anyway I hope you will find the time to read this rather rambly but very complimentary review of your absolutely breathtaking work! Please continue if you have the chance I can't wait to find out what happens next!","Targeted positive and corrective/constructive,One-sided connection,Update encouragement,Discussion about the story","Joy / Happiness,Like,Anticipation / Hope",Positive

8382947,"Review time: This scene between Sorina and the brothers from this movie crossover is a bit odd what with all this orgy talk. Anyway, are these two really here just so they can make sure no boys make a move on her? Seems a bit extreme. As Buzz Lightyear would say about this love square scene involving Axel, Zoey, Mike, and Katie: ""Shipping. Shipping everywhere."" Sensation is Amazing meter: 11. And please contain your boners Axel. You're in it for the money first, remember? The aforementioned Buzz Lightyear line could be applied for Scarletta and Bridgette. We gotta slow down some of this shipping. I'm going to challenge you with something. Axel/Zoey, Mike/Katie, Jo/Brick, Noah/That chick he's being shipped with, Geoff/Mary, AND Scarletta/Bridgette all can't be officially a couple for at least 5 more chapters. Geoff and Bridgette are still together, as is Mike and Zoey. Spend those chapters leading up to how those couple will break apart. As for the others, take the establishing between them slowly. Maybe one or two flirtatious lines exchanged between the couple each chapter, leading up to them deciding to become a couple. We'll talk more about this later. I like Lightning's strategy for teaming up with Heather. It reminds me of a similar strategy that someone in a future story of mine will have. How, exactly, does watching campers make it to their cabins create ratings? Why not just say that you thought it would be more fun, Chris? So the Drama Brothers still exist in this alternate universe where TDA never happened? to go off on a limb and guess that they help either Harold or Ezekiel. Sensation is Amazing Meter: 12 Sensation is Amazing Meter: 13 ""Holy mother of amazing sensations"" wins line of the day. Sensation is Amazing Meter: 14 ""his little head"" Ha...it's his penis. OH FUCK, IT'S A SEX SCENE. Skipping powers, activate! I'm not going back to check to see if you used the line during the sex, but since Geoff used it in the first line after it: Sensation is Amazing Meter: 15 Aww, looks like Geoff is going to be a bad guy in this story. This is jerk levels that I would expect from someone like Duncan. At least Bridgette will probably get revenge with lesbian sex later. Oh, and I guess forget what I said about taking time with Geoff and Mary. You kind of just made them shag, so there's no point in it. Still take time with Bridgette/Scarletta though. Have her have to get over the heartbreak before she hooks up with the Italian. And by take some time, I mean longer than one chapter. That line about having to leave due to everything being layered in Geoff's man juices made me gag, yet was also hilarious. Also, jesus, how much can that dude fit in a single climax? I feel bad for the people who have to sleep in that cabin. Whoa now, you just jumped into Bridgette's scene. Did she see Geoff kissing Mary like Heather said in her plan, or did she spot their sexcapades? Go back and explain that. So much Italian. It's hard to sympathize with Scarletta when I can't understand what she's saying. Singing? Lol, skipping powers, looks like you get to pull a double shift this chapter. Oh wait, never mind. We're singing a Queen song. Does that mean Axel is Freddie Mercury? I can't comprehend that much awesome. Geez, where did we get guns? Looks like Justin came to the wrong neighborhood. ...what knocked out Samantha? Both times you tried to say what it was it got cut off. Wow, Chef...that's the oddest analogy I've heard in quite some time. Whoa, why is Selen in our team's confessional? She's on the other team. I think that should have been Nick saying that confessional. Also, as I read on, Sam and Jade seem to be chilling in the background a bit so far. Maybe they're waiting to do something big in one of the next chapters. Actually, Seth knocked out the first act, not the final one. Also, I'm guessing he caused Samantha to be knocked out. Should go back and explain that. Pretty surprising elimination. I feel like Seth has a high chance of returning. Looks like we'll have to wait and see. Ugh, I realize Bridgette has gone through a lot, but love is a strong word. Way to early for anyone in this story to be using. I guess we can knock Bridgette/Scarletta off the shipping list that you need to take slowly as well. We'll talk more about the shipping later. Good chapter. There were some errors that need fixing, but it was still good. Before you update again, I want to try and help you on the shipping parts of the story since they're an important part of it. Guess I should also do these references things: 1-Shrek 2-Osmosis Jones? If I'm right, I'm surprised someone else remembers this movie. 3-Duke Nukem. Does Joshua also have balls of steel? 4-He should have said ""Wuz good, nigga? What's really good?"" 5-Working hard, or hardly working.","Targeted positive and corrective/constructive,Discussion about the story,One-sided connection","Surprise,Like",Positive

Porque ""el tío Harry"" ama a Draco y a su vida, pero el Harry auror ama a sus hijos y ¡joder! Entiendo que puedas llegar a aceptar nunca haber estado con tu esposa (entiendo que ver a Ginny mucho más ""feliz"" debe ser duro) y llegar a aceptar que amas a otro (porque Harry auror está sintiendo grandes cosas por Draco). Pero los hijos... En mi mente, para Harry Potter una familia lo es todo y los hijos lo son aún más. Todo padre haría lo que fuera por sus hijos, es la historia de JK, todo padre o madre lucha por sus hijos (o casi todos). Harry auror debe sentirse horrible al recordar que ninguno de sus bebés está y no puedo desear con el alma que decida quedarse allí (¿y qué hay del tío Harry? ¿dónde está?). Quiero que tenga a sus hijos o pueda decirle a Draco sobre ellos o pueda volver y hablar con el Draco divorciado que no es el Draco toc, pero... no pueden desaparecer y cuando llegue ese momento, el de decidir, mi corazón se hará trizas.

His hitai-ate looks a little different from their symbol, so it's either a screw-up of Hidden Rain's symbol or it may even be an entirely new village. Two, even if he is an ex-Mist nin, I doubt he's a member of the Seven Swordsmen as he doesn't actually wield a sword. Personally, I doubt he even uses water jutsus as that would not only be sorely unoriginal, but, in the latest chapters, Tobi mentions that Kisame is the only user of water jutsus in Akstsuki. Actually, he says that since the Sanbi is a water demon, it'd be better if they chose someone who uses water jutsus like Kisame. No mention of Hidan or Kakuzu (who is from Hidden Waterfall and thus, would presumably know some water jutsus).",Fandom remarks,No emotion,Neutral

A decir verdad, simpaticé bastante con Rex, y me atrevería a afirmar que es posible que se convierta en mi favorito. Makoto, por otra parte, me a sorprendido bastante el giro que le has dado a su personalidad, pues en el primer capítulo todo parecía indicar que se trataba del arquetipo de niño tierno...¡Y VAYA SORPRESA!

11336522,"Hmm. I like this story and the fact that you touch upon the gender prejudice in the Imperialistic Era of China within the army. However, there are some points I'd like to touch on, which didn't make sense to me: I know that this is from Shang's POV, so it might be a little bias that he thinks overly highly of Mulan's fighting abilities. I mean, most people take years of intense training to become actual masters of a martial arts style and we saw from the movie that Mulan is not a prodigy (although she is exceptionally strong willed and extremely hard working). And though you can argue that her father taught her some, with his condition, I doubt he could effectively demonstrate the more complex moves (especially jumping). That said, you might want to tone down her fighting prowess a bit. Not saying that she isn't a good fighter, but given the timeline she's more experienced in fighting by an militarized training style than by a specialized martial arts style. You could say that someone her father knows showed her how to do a few (not too much, given the time limit) moves and that would be more plausible. Another point I'd like to make is the deference Mulan isn't giving Shang in front of the rest of the subordinates. A fight like this, although entertaining to read because you do write a good fight scene, should never have occurred in the first place because they are on a mission and Shang is their superior officer. Soldiers are trained to show respect to their superior officers and as a general, Shang is expected to keep a professional distance from his subordinates (otherwise, it's like having a judge discuss the politics in the upcoming election with the attorneys while in the middle of a court session). Therefore, Mulan should never have asked Shang for a spar in the first place because that can be seen as a challenge to his authority and would be held against her as her having a lack of propriety and a poor sense of judgment (if they're in supposed unfriendly territory), and considering the company they're keeping too, that's the last thing they'd want to do. And as a side note, this could make Shang seem incompetent as a general (the decision to partake in a spar on a mission and the fact that he lost -unfair, I know, but people expect leaders to be on a level above them and can take it as an insult if he shows that he wasn't-) Instead, it might have been better and brought a point home to these men if she had fought one of them (because they could also take her win as Shang going easy on her -it's because they know Shang is on her side; people would still doubt others if their friend supports them but will have no choice but to believe in others when an enemy does-). This brings me to my final point: the favoritism Shang is displaying towards Mulan. The fact that the pranks were played on her were discreet and that there was no direct evidence of who carried them out meant that the matter shouldn't have been brought to his attention (officially speaking). In a case where these men are actively trying to find ways to discredit Mulan, calling such cases out just because it inconvenienced a single soldier (unless she complained herself, and she definitely doesn't want to do that -she'd be ostracized as a snitch AND a woman-) would only show that Shang doesn't actually see her as another soldier and does treat her as special (and it shows that Mulan can't take care of herself without help -another thing she'd like to avoid-). Shang is a general and he making these special allowances for Mulan is unprofessional and would only portray favoritism towards her in front of the others, which wouldn't help her show that she is no different from the male soldiers. It's not fair, true, but for prejudice to grow strong only takes a small seed of discord and demonstrating even a niblet of favoritism can create that seed. It probably would have been better and more convincing if Mulan took care of the problem herself. In doing so, she can also gain the respect she deserves from the other soldiers (kill 2 birds with 1 stone). That's about all. I do like the chemistry between Mulan and Shang (albeit a tad too sappy for my taste). And I want to see Mushu and Cri-kee, although I absolutely love Kang. I like this story and would like to see where it goes.","Targeted positive and corrective/constructive,Discussion about the story,Fandom remarks,Update encouragement","Like,Anticipation / Hope",Positive

288466,"My lord, this chapter seriously took me by surprise. I absolutely love how you've written Sasuke coming to terms with his feelings for Sakura and how mad he was at Madara. Speaking of Madara, I absolutely adore how you've written him. The pacing for his feelings aren't too fast, the night terrors are really descriptive, and the raw emotion he exhibits throughout this story absolutely entices me. I believe it was the third chapter that made me cry but I kept on reading, forgetting that I was supposed to review on how amazing this story is. This story seriously deserves more reviews. Please keep up the good work, I'd really love to continue reading this story till the end.","Targeted positive,One-sided connection,Update encouragement","Joy / Happiness,Surprise,Like,Sadness",Positive
